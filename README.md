# Training Buddy

Training buddy is a simple cross-platform lightweight fitness app that is designed to run on Windows, MacOS and Linux.
It is written in python, uses matplotlib library to create graphs, and tkinter for GUI.

### What may happen in the future

- if the app turns out to be really useful, Kiwi comes to the rescue, so anyone may access training buddy through a smartphone;
- if the app turns out to be really-really useful and fun to use, it might even grow into some kind of a small social fitness network.
